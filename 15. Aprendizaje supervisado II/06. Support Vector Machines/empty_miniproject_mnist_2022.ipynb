    "## Recommendations in notebook writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are a great tool for data and model exploration. But in that process a lot of Python garbage can get into them as a consequence of the trial and error process.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once these tasks are done and one arrives to final ideas and insights on the problem under study, the notebook should be **thoroughly cleaned** and the notebook should **concentrate on the insights and conclussions** without, of course, throwing away the good work done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below there are a few guidelines about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Put the useful bits of your code as functions on a **Python module** (plus script, if needed) that is imported at the notebook's beginning. \n",
    "* Of course that module should be **properly documented** and **formatted** (try to learn about PEP 8 if you are going to write a lot of Python).\n",
    "* Leave in the notebook **as little code as possible**, ideally one- or two-line cells calling a function, plotting results or so on.\n",
    "* **Avoid boilerplate code**. If needed, put it in a module.\n",
    "* Put on the notebook some way to **hide/display the code** (as shown below).\n",
    "* The displayed information **should be just that, informative**. So forget about large tables, long output cells, dataframe or array displays and so on.\n",
    "* Emphasize **insights and conclusions**, using as much markdown as needed to clarifiy and explain them.\n",
    "* Make sure that **number cells consecutively starting at 1.**\n",
    "* And, of course, make sure that **there are no errors left**. To avoid these last pitfalls, run `Kernel\\Restart Kernel and Run All Cells`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And notice that whoever reads your notebook is likely to toggle off your code and consider just the markdown cells. Because of this, once you feel that your notebook is finished,\n",
    "* let it rest for one day, \n",
    "* then open it up, toggle off the code \n",
    "* and read it to check **whether it makes sense to you**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is not the case, **the notebook is NOT finished!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these rules you are much more likely to get good grades at school (and possibly also larger bonuses at work)."
