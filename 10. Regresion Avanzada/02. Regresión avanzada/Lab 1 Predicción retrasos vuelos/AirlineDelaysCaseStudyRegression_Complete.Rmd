# Introduction 

On any given day, more than 90,000 flights operate in the US. About one-third of these flights are commercial flights, operated by companies like United, American Airlines, etc. Among these commercial flights, 20% suffer from delays due to various reasons. A certain number of delays are unavoidable, due to unexpected events, but some delays could hopefully be avoided if the factors causing delays are better understood and addressed.

In this case study, we will use a dataset with 9,381 flights that occurred in June-August, 2014 between the three busiest US airports:

  - Atlanta (ATL)
  - Los Angeles (LAX)
  - Chicago (ORD)
  
### The dataset  
  
The dataset AirlineDelay.csv includes the following 23 variables:

- Flight = the origin-destination pair (LAX-ORD, ATL-LAX, etc.)
- Carrier = the carrier operating the flight (American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, etc.)
- Month = the month of the flight (June, July, or August)
- DayOfWeek = the day of the week of the flight (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- NumPrevFlights = the number of previous flights taken by this aircraft in the same day
- PrevFlightGap = the amount of time between when this flight's aircraft is scheduled to arrive at the airport and when it's scheduled to depart for this flight
- HistoricallyLate = the proportion of time this flight has been late historically
- InsufficientHistory = whether or not we have enough data to determine the historical record of the flight (equal to 1 if we don't have at least 3 records, equal to 0 if we do)
- OriginInVolume = the amount of incoming traffic volume at the origin airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- OriginOutVolume = the amount of outgoing traffic volume at the origin airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- DestInVolume = the amount of incoming traffic volume at the destination airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- DestOutVolume = the amount of outgoing traffic volume at the destination airport, normalized by the typical volume during the flight's time and day of the week
- OriginPrecip = the amount of rain at the origin over the course of the day, in tenths of millimeters
- OriginAvgWind = average daily wind speed at the origin, in miles per hour
- OriginWindGust = fastest wind speed during the day at the origin, in miles per hour
- OriginFog = whether or not there was fog at some point during the day at the origin (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- OriginThunder = whether or not there was thunder at some point during the day at the origin (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- DestPrecip = the amount of rain at the destination over the course of the day, in tenths of millimeters
- DestAvgWind = average daily wind speed at the destination, in miles per hour
- DestWindGust = fastest wind speed during the day at the destination, in miles per hour
- DestFog = whether or not there was fog at some point during the day at the destination (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- DestThunder = whether or not there was thunder at some point during the day at the destination (1 if there was, 0 if there wasn't)
- TotalDelay = the amount of time the aircraft was delayed, in minutes (this is our dependent variable)

### The goal

Predict the response TotalDelay as a function of the other variables

### Descriptive Analysis

It is always a good idea to separate from the beginning the training set (what the tool is going to see) from the testing set (used only to validate predictions)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
library(caret)
library(e1071) 

# Loading and preparing data
Airlines <- read.csv("AirlineDelay.csv", stringsAsFactors=T)

# split between training and testing sets
spl = createDataPartition(Airlines$TotalDelay, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)  # 80% for training

AirlinesTrain = Airlines[spl,]
AirlinesTest = Airlines[-spl,]

str(AirlinesTrain)

summary(AirlinesTrain)
```

Insights?

### Visualization

Add here interesting plots to get information, taking into account the most important variable

```{r}
ggplot(AirlinesTrain, aes(TotalDelay)) + geom_density(fill="lightblue") + xlab("TotalDelay") + ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution")

```

Most of the flights have a delay less than 1 min (Q1=0, Q2=1, Q3=18)

Highly asymmetric distribution

```{r}
ggplot(AirlinesTrain, aes(log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_density(fill="lightblue") + xlab("log(TotalDelay+10)") + ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution")
```

Seems roughly two groups: one with delays less than 7 min (approx) and the other greater (approx)

Or a second group with center (mode) at 10 min

Moreover, half of the observations have a TotalDelay==0

Should we omit those observations?

```{r}
# AirlinesTrain = filter(AirlinesTrain, TotalDelay>0)
# AirlinesTest = filter(AirlinesTest, TotalDelay>0)
```

Any simple idea to predict delays?

```{r}
# For instance, we can predict all the new delays as the median delay in the training set
median(AirlinesTrain$TotalDelay)
```


We can even add more visual information:

```{r}
# TotalDelay vs HistoricallyLate
ggplot(AirlinesTrain, aes(x=HistoricallyLate, y=log(TotalDelay+10))) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.8) + ggtitle("TotalDelay vs HistoricallyLate")
# not a clear relation, maybe some non-linearities?

ggplot(AirlinesTrain, aes(log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_density(aes(group=Flight, colour=Flight, fill=Flight), alpha=0.1) + 
  ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution")
# Not so many differences in the 6 flights, but LAX-ATL has less delays

ggplot(AirlinesTrain, aes(log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_density(aes(group=Carrier, colour=Carrier, fill=Carrier), alpha=0.1) + 
  ggtitle("TotalDelay distribution")
# SkyWest Airlines seems to have more delays

ggplot(AirlinesTrain, aes(x=as.factor(NumPrevFlights), y=log(TotalDelay+10))) + geom_boxplot(fill="blue") +
  ggtitle("TotalDelay vs NumPrevFlights")
# number of previous flights seems to increase delay, in a monotic but non-linear way

```

Note for categorical variables it is better to use boxplots

For numerical variables, better scatter plots

And even more plots:

```{r}
featurePlot(x = AirlinesTrain[, c(9:16)],
            y = log(AirlinesTrain$TotalDelay+10),
            plot = "scatter",
            layout = c(4, 2))
# insights?

featurePlot(x = AirlinesTrain[, c(17:22)],
            y = log(AirlinesTrain$TotalDelay+10),
            plot = "scatter",
            layout = c(2, 3))
# insights?
```


# A review of regression

Which are the most correlated variables with Delay?

```{r}
corr_delay <- sort(cor(AirlinesTrain[,c(5:23)])["TotalDelay",], decreasing = T)
corr=data.frame(corr_delay)
ggplot(corr,aes(x = row.names(corr), y = corr_delay)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") + 
  scale_x_discrete(limits= row.names(corr)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "TotalDelay", title = "Correlations") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, size = rel(1.5)),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Insights?

Simple regression: try first the most relevant predictor from previous analysis

```{r}
linFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ HistoricallyLate, data=AirlinesTrain)
summary(linFit)
```

Insights?

### Prediction

```{r}
# Take care: output is in logs
predictions <- exp(predict(linFit, newdata=AirlinesTest))-10
cor(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay, predictions)^2
```

Note the $R^2$ in the testing set is now less than that in the training set. Why?


### Multiple regression

If we include more variables in the model, the prediction accuracy could be improved

Try some multiple regression models and compute performance measures in the testing set

```{r}
linFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ ., data=AirlinesTrain)
summary(linFit)
```

Prediction:

```{r}
pred.log <- predict(linFit, newdata=AirlinesTest)
cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), pred.log)^2
```

Many variables non-significant: high collinearity, not useful to explain (overfitting)

But useful to predict: R2 is roughly 20% in the testing

Other performance measures: MAPE and RMSE

```{r}
# Error in percentage (mape):
MAPE = mean(abs(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10)- pred.log)/log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))
MAPE

# Testing residual standard-error:
RMSE <- sqrt(mean((pred.log - log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))^2))
RMSE
# this is similar to the Residual standard error in summary(linFit) because units are in logs

# This is the RMSE in minutes:
sqrt(mean((predictions - AirlinesTest$TotalDelay)^2))

```

# Advanced regression models

A basic multiple regression model with interactions:

```{r}
linFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ OriginAvgWind + OriginPrecip + DestAvgWind + DestPrecip + HistoricallyLate +
               OriginPrecip:DestPrecip, data=AirlinesTrain)

summary(linFit)
pred.log <- predict(linFit, newdata=AirlinesTest)
cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), pred.log)^2

```

R2 in the training is 10%

R2 in the testing is around 10%

An even more advanced model using categorical variables: for instance, Flight has 6 categories but R creates 5 dummies, why?

Useful to incorporate interactions between categorical variables and numeric ones

```{r}
linFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ Flight*(OriginAvgWind+OriginPrecip+DestAvgWind+DestPrecip+OriginWindGust+HistoricallyLate)+I(HistoricallyLate^2)+OriginPrecip:DestPrecip, data=AirlinesTrain)
summary(linFit)

pred.log <- predict(linFit, newdata=AirlinesTest)
cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), pred.log)^2

```

R2 in the training is 14%

R2 in the testing is around 14%

Note the multiple regression model including all the variables is still the best

**Important question:** how do we know we are doing well?

Always consider a benchmark model (or a reference)

For instance, we can predict all the new delays as the average delay in the training set

```{r}
mean(log(AirlinesTrain$TotalDelay+10))
# This is equivalent to
benchFit <- lm(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ 1, data=AirlinesTrain)
pred.bench <- predict(benchFit, newdata=AirlinesTest)
```

```{r, eval=F}
cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), pred.bench)^2
```

Why cannot we compute the R2?

```{r}
mean(abs(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10)- pred.bench)/log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))
sqrt(mean((pred.bench - log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))^2))
```

The naive prediction is about 10% worse than our best model

# Robust Regression

Choose any of the next models (or any other):

```{r}
model = log(TotalDelay+10) ~ Flight*(OriginAvgWind+OriginPrecip+DestAvgWind+DestPrecip+OriginWindGust+HistoricallyLate)+I(HistoricallyLate^2)+OriginPrecip:DestPrecip

model = log(TotalDelay+10) ~ .

linFit <- lm(model, data=AirlinesTrain)

```

Residuals

```{r}
ggplot() + aes(x=AirlinesTrain$HistoricallyLate, y=rstudent(linFit)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=c(-2.33,2.33), color="blue") + theme_minimal()
```

Some outliers in the top (real delays bigger than expected)

Diagnostic plots: residuals, fitted values, Cook’s distance, and leverage

```{r}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2), oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0))
plot(linFit, las = 1)

```

Some outliers

Prediction

```{r}
prLM <- predict(linFit, newdata=AirlinesTest)

cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), prLM)^2

mean(abs(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10)- prLM)/log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))

```


## Huber estimation

```{r}
linfit.huber <- rlm(model, data=AirlinesTrain)
summary(linfit.huber)
```

Prediction

```{r}
prHuber <- predict(linfit.huber, newdata=AirlinesTest)

cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), prHuber)^2
mean(abs(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10)- prHuber)/log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))

```


## Bi-square estimation

```{r}
linfit.bisquare <- rlm(model, data=AirlinesTrain, psi = psi.bisquare)
summary(linfit.bisquare)
```

Prediction

```{r}
prBi <- predict(linfit.bisquare, newdata=AirlinesTest)

cor(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10), prBi)^2
mean(abs(log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10)- prBi)/log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))
```

Some improvement

When comparing the results of OLS regression with robust regression, if the results are very different, better to use the results from the robust regression: more reliable

Large differences suggest that the model parameters are being highly influenced by outliers

Different loss functions have advantages and drawbacks. Huber weights can have difficulties with severe outliers, and bisquare weights can have difficulties converging or may yield multiple solutions

# An introduction to Caret

Highly recommended package

  - to evaluate performance and calibrate sensitive parameters
  
  - to choose the best model across these parameters
  
  - to estimate model performance from a training set
  
  - Main function: train()
  
tidymodels is the tidy version of caret (collection of packages for modelling)

These are the models for regression and classification:

```{r}
names(getModelInfo()) 
```

## Tuning

Each model can be automatically tuned and evaluated 

Example: use 5 repeats of 10-fold cross validation

```{r}
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                     repeats = 5,
                     number = 10)
```

We can also choose bootstrap, LOOCV, etc.

If we want to fix the hyper-parameters (no tuning), then no trainControl is needed

```{r}
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "none")
```

## The train function

This function sets up a grid of tuning parameters for a number of classification and regression routines, fits each model and calculates a resampling based performance measure

Let's first save our predictions and real observations in a data frame

```{r}
test_results <- data.frame(TotalDelay = log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10))

observed = log(AirlinesTest$TotalDelay+10)
```

Linear regression with Caret:

```{r}
lm_tune <- train(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ ., 
                 data = AirlinesTrain, 
                 method = "lm", 
                 preProc=c('scale', 'center'),
                 trControl = ctrl)
```

Prediction

```{r}
test_results$lm <- predict(lm_tune, AirlinesTest)

postResample(pred = test_results$lm,  obs = observed)
```

Plot

```{r}
qplot(observed, test_results$lm) +
  lims(x = c(2, 6), y = c(2, 6)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, colour = "blue") +
  ggtitle("Linear Regression Observed VS Predicted")
```

Robust regression with Caret

Because here we have, we are going to use 5-fold cross validation for tuning

```{r}
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                     number = 5)

# take care: rlm does not work very well with categorical variables
rlm_tune <- train(log(TotalDelay+10) ~ ., 
                  data = AirlinesTrain[,c(-1,-2,-3,-4)], 
                  method = "rlm", 
                  preProc=c('scale', 'center'),
                  trControl = ctrl)

rlm_tune
```

Numerically unstable...

Predict and plot

```{r}
test_results$rlm <- predict(rlm_tune, AirlinesTest[,c(-1,-2,-3,-4)])
postResample(pred = test_results$rlm,  obs = observed)
qplot(observed, test_results$rlm) +
  lims(x = c(2, 6), y = c(2, 6)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, colour = "blue") +
  ggtitle("Robust Regression Observed VS Predicted")

```
